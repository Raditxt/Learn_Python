# Python Learning Journey

Welcome to this repository! This is a documentation and collection of code from my journey learning the Python programming language. This repository will evolve as my learning progresses, from basics to advanced topics.

## Description

This repository contains various Python files created during my learning process. Each file focuses on a specific topic, with comments and code examples to facilitate understanding.

## File Structure

- `Basic_Syntax.py`: File for learning basic Python syntax, such as variables, data types, operators, and control structures.
- `Variables/`: Folder containing files related to Python variables.
  - `Variables_in_Python.py`: Introduction to variables in Python, explained simply using the Feynman Technique.
  - `Working_With_Variables.py`: How to work with variables in Python, including expressions, counters, and input/output.

## How to Run

To run a Python file, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Use the following command in the terminal:

```
python Basic_Syntax.py
```

Or for files in the Variables folder:

```
python Variables/Variables_in_Python.py
python Variables/Working_With_Variables.py
```

## Topics Learned

- Basic Python Syntax
- Variables and Data Types
- Working with Variables (expressions, counters, input/output)
- Operators
- Control Structures (if-else, loops)
- Functions
- (More topics will be added over time)
